# Database

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL has been chosen as the database for the project. It is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. 

### ACID

PostgreSQL is ACID-compliant. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

### JSONB

PostgreSQL has a native JSONB data type that allows you to store JSON documents efficiently. It is a binary representation of JSON data, which is more efficient to store and query.
