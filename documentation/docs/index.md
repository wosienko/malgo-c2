# Malgo - Developer Documentation

This is a developer documentation - a document not only describing how Malgo Command & Control works, but also how to contribute to it.

## What is Malgo

Malgo is a Command & Control framework designed by Red Team Operators for Red Team Operators. The main goal is to render starting new projects easier than ever. There is no need for hassle with setting up new servers from the ground up each time.

## Why is Malgo

Thus far, every single C2 framework is widely fingerprinted and needs severe obfucation and reconfiguration to make it somewhat usable in the field.
Moreover, every solution requires that new server be started for each new engagement, rendering preparations more tedious.
As if that was not enough, advanced solutions are very pricey. There is no need for these expenses.
